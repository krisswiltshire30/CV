After working as an IT support professional for 7 years, I have decided to change my career path in search of a new challenge that will utilise my tech knowledge, meticulous attention to detail, and friendly, professional manner. I am the kind of person that likes to tinker, open up electric devices to see how they work and attempt to make them better, or at least make it do something it wasn't designed to do in the first place. The mindset of diving into something to see how it works is the reason I enjoy coding.

## Skills

#### Team Player
From my time at makers acadamy I have actioned the tools I have learnt to be a great team member. From being empathetic to other members, giving non biased feedback, and implementing ways of making the team work better together. In one of our teams, we had a lot of strong personalities which meant a lot of cross talk. To combat this I implemented the 'frog' method, meaning that whoever held the toy frog could speak and not be spoken over. I am not the type of person to talk over other people and will always let someone have their say.

#### Problem solver
I very much enjoy the challange of a good problem. My past career as an IT engineer meant that I was always finding new solutions to old and new problems. I take a problem, disect it into its core components and work through it granularly, taking the causes and effects and create a fix that is well documented and easy to explain.

#### Documenter
Taking information about a project and creating clear concise documentation is a point of pride for me. Be it in the form of a well written readme, a wiki page outlining our process for a project, or taking the minutes of a team meeting.

#### Knowledge sharer
I find knowledge sharing to be one of the most important aspects of working in a great team. From working in teams at makers, to my past career, I have found that one person holding all the information can expose a single point of failure. Not only does knowledge sharing allow a team to all be  on the same level, but sharing what you have learnt can help consolidate your understanding.
